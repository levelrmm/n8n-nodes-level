# n8n-nodes-level

Official [n8n](https://n8n.io) community nodes for [Level.io](https://level.io), the RMM and automation platform for modern MSPs. These nodes let you orchestrate Level alerts, devices, groups, automations, and webhook events directly from your n8n workflows.

## Installation

Follow the [community node installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) to add `n8n-nodes-level` to your n8n instance. Once installed, the Level nodes appear in the n8n editor under **Level**.

## Operations

### Level node

| Resource | Operations |
| --- | --- |
| Alert | Get alert by ID, List alerts |
| Automation | Trigger webhook |
| Device | Get device by ID, List devices |
| Group | Get group by ID, List groups |

### Level Trigger node

The trigger node listens for signed webhook events from Level and emits them into your workflows. Supported event types include alert, device, group, and automation lifecycle notifications.

## Credentials

Create the following credentials in n8n:

- **Level API** – Generate an API key from the Level dashboard (**Settings → API Keys**) and store it in this credential. Assign it to the Level node (and to the trigger if you enrich incoming events with REST calls).
- **Level Webhook Secret** – Copy the signing secret from **Settings → Webhooks** in Level and store it in this credential. Assign it to the Level Trigger node when you want to verify incoming webhook signatures.

## Compatibility

These nodes target `n8nNodesApiVersion` 1 and are developed against n8n v1.60.0 and later. Earlier releases of n8n might not expose all required node features.

## Usage

1. **Add credentials** – In n8n, open *Settings → Credentials* and create both a **Level API** credential (API key) and a **Level Webhook Secret** credential (webhook signing secret).
2. **Automate API calls** – Place the **Level** node in a workflow to query alerts, devices, or groups, or to invoke an automation webhook by token. Use the *Response Property Name* parameter to reshape the API response when needed.
3. **React to webhooks** – Add the **Level Trigger** node, select the event types you want to handle, and copy the webhook URL generated by n8n. Configure this URL and the shared secret in Level so events flow into your workflow securely.
4. **Chain actions** – Combine Level data with other n8n nodes to notify teams, update tickets, or enrich records in downstream systems.

Refer to the [Level API reference](https://levelapi.readme.io/reference/getting-started-with-your-api) for endpoint details, pagination behavior, and payload schemas when building workflows.
