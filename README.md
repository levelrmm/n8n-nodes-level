# n8n-nodes-level

Official [n8n](https://n8n.io) community nodes for [Level.io](https://level.io), the RMM and automation platform for modern MSPs. These nodes let you orchestrate Level alerts, devices, groups, automations, and webhook events directly from your n8n workflows.

## Installation

Follow the [community node installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) to add `n8n-nodes-level` to your n8n instance. Once installed, the Level nodes appear in the n8n editor under **Level**.

## Operations

### Level node

| Resource | Operations |
| --- | --- |
| Alerts | Get alert by ID, List alerts |
| Automations | Trigger webhook |
| Devices | Get device by ID, List devices |
| Groups | Get group by ID, List groups |

### Level Trigger node

The trigger node listens for signed webhook events from Level and emits them into your workflows. Supported event types include alert, device, group, and automation lifecycle notifications.

## Credentials

Create a **Level API** credential in n8n with the following values:

1. **API Key** – Generate a key from the Level dashboard. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys** in Level, create a new key, and copy the value.
2. **Webhook Secret** *(optional but recommended)* – Define a webhook secret in Level under **Settings → Webhooks** and reuse the same value in the credential to verify incoming trigger signatures.

Assign the credential to both the Level node and Level Trigger node. The API key secures outgoing REST calls, and the webhook secret is used for HMAC signature validation on incoming webhooks.

## Compatibility

These nodes target `n8nNodesApiVersion` 1 and are developed against n8n v1.60.0 and later. Earlier releases of n8n might not expose all required node features.

## Usage

1. **Add credentials** – In n8n, open *Settings → Credentials* and create a new credential using the **Level API** type with your API key (and optional webhook secret).
2. **Automate API calls** – Place the **Level** node in a workflow to query alerts, devices, or groups, or to invoke an automation webhook by token. Use the *Response Property Name* parameter to reshape the API response when needed.
3. **React to webhooks** – Add the **Level Trigger** node, select the event types you want to handle, and copy the webhook URL generated by n8n. Configure this URL and the shared secret in Level so events flow into your workflow securely.
4. **Chain actions** – Combine Level data with other n8n nodes to notify teams, update tickets, or enrich records in downstream systems.

Refer to the [Level API reference](https://levelapi.readme.io/reference/getting-started-with-your-api) for endpoint details, pagination behavior, and payload schemas when building workflows.
